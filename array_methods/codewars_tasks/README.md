1) In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
2) Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
   String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.
3) You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
4) Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
   We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
   The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
5) Your task is to complete the function which takes a string, and returns an array with all possible rotations of the given string, in uppercase.
6) Write a function that takes a single non-empty string of only lowercase and uppercase ascii letters (word) as its argument, and returns an ordered list containing the indices of all capital (uppercase) letters in the string.
7) Write a function that takes an integer num (num >= 0) and inserts dashes ('-') between each two odd digits in num.
8) Given a two-dimensional array, return a new array which carries over only those arrays from the original, which were not empty and whose items are all of the same type (i.e. homogenous). For simplicity, the arrays inside the array will only contain characters and integers.
9) Using the examples above as a guide, write a function that takes an email address string and returns the obfuscated version as a string that replaces the characters @ and . with [at] and [dot], respectively.
